              Imagine you are tracking your grades this semester. In your notebook you have the numbers
              18, 25, 9, and 10 written in a line. No labels. No subjects. No descriptions. On their own,
              those values do not really tell you anything. They are just raw values with no meaning.
            </p>

            <p>
              That is what we call <strong>data</strong>. Data is any collection of raw facts and figures.
              It can be numbers, words, images, sensor readings, click logs, or survey responses. The key
              idea is that data exists, but by itself it does not yet answer any question.
            </p>

            <p>
              To see the difference, look at the same values in a small grade record.
            </p>

            <table class="notes-table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Activity</th>
                  <th>Score</th>
                  <th>Maximum</th>
                  <th>Percentage</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Quiz 1</td>
                  <td>18</td>
                  <td>20</td>
                  <td>90%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Quiz 2</td>
                  <td>25</td>
                  <td>30</td>
                  <td>83%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Seatwork</td>
                  <td>9</td>
                  <td>10</td>
                  <td>90%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Project</td>
                  <td>10</td>
                  <td>10</td>
                  <td>100%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="notes-table-summary">
                  <td>Average</td>
                  <td colspan="2">overall quiz and classwork</td>
                  <td>90.75%</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
              In the table, the same numbers now have labels and structure. You know what each score belongs
              to, how you performed, and how the activities compare. The data was not changed, but it was
              organized and presented clearly.
            </p>

            <p>
              At this point you are no longer looking at random values. You are looking at
              <strong>information</strong>. Information is data that has been processed, organized, or
              structured so that it answers simple questions like <q>What happened?</q>. Teachers, managers,
              and computer systems create information when they format, summarize, calculate, and present
              data in a useful way through tables, charts, or reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you keep recording your quiz and project scores over several weeks, you might notice a
              pattern. Maybe your project scores are always high, while your quiz scores drop whenever
              there is a strict time limit. That observation does not come from one line of numbers. It
              comes from looking at information over time and thinking about it.
            </p>

            <p>
              That deeper understanding is <strong>knowledge</strong>. Knowledge is the result of taking
              information, connecting it with experience, and using it to make decisions. With that
              knowledge you might decide to practice more under time pressure, review specific topics, or
              ask your teacher for help.
            </p>

            <p>
              In organizations, people use knowledge to answer questions like <q>Why is this happening?</q>
              and <q>What should we do next?</q>. Computer systems help by collecting and storing large
              amounts of data, turning them into information through processing and visualization, and
              then making that information easy to access.
            </p>

            <p>
              In short, <strong>data</strong> is raw input, <strong>information</strong> is processed and
              organized output, and <strong>knowledge</strong> is human understanding built on top of that
              information. A simple way to remember the flow is:
              <strong>Data → Information → Knowledge → Action</strong>.
