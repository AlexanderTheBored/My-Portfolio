              Data privacy as a central ethical issue in IT
            </h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            One of the most important ethical issues in Information Technology is
            <strong>data privacy</strong>. Modern systems collect large amounts of personal
            information from users, such as names, locations, financial records, medical histories,
            browsing behavior, and private messages. If this information is misused, leaked, or
            accessed by unauthorized people, it can cause serious harm, including identity theft,
            fraud, harassment, or loss of trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Problems often start with how data is <strong>collected and managed</strong>.
            Some applications gather more information than they really need, or fail to clearly
            explain what they are collecting and why. In other cases, organizations do not secure
            their systems properly. Weak passwords, poor encryption, or unpatched software can make
            it easier for attackers to break in and steal sensitive information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <strong>IT Code of Ethics</strong> gives guidelines for how IT professionals should
            behave when they handle personal data. One key principle is <strong>respect for
            privacy and confidentiality</strong>. This means limiting access to personal data only
            to authorized people, avoiding unnecessary data collection, and never using confidential
            information for personal gain or curiosity. IT professionals should be open with users
            about what data is being collected and how it will be used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another important principle is <strong>integrity</strong>. IT workers are expected to
            use strong security measures, keep systems up to date, and prevent unauthorized access.
            When a data breach happens, the ethical response includes reporting the incident quickly,
            cooperating with investigations, and taking steps to prevent the same problem in the
            future. Hiding or ignoring a breach is considered irresponsible and unethical.
          </p>

          <p>
            The IT Code of Ethics also emphasizes <strong>accountability</strong>. Professionals
            must take responsibility for their actions, keep learning about new threats and privacy
            laws, and avoid negligence. Data privacy is not just a technical problem. It is a moral
            duty. By following the Code of Ethics, IT professionals help create a digital
            environment where users can trust that their personal information is treated with
            fairness, honesty, and respect.
          </p>

            <p>
              Data privacy is a major ethical challenge in IT. The IT Code of Ethics guides
              professionals to respect confidentiality, protect systems, be transparent with users,
              and take responsibility for their actions.

              <strong>Ethical issue: data privacy</strong><br />
              Organizations collect large amounts of personal data, and misuse or leaks can lead to
              identity theft, fraud, and loss of trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem with collection and use</strong><br />
              Many users do not fully know what data is collected or why, and some systems gather
              more information than necessary or fail to secure it properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Privacy and confidentiality</strong><br />
              The IT Code of Ethics says professionals must protect personal data, limit access to
              authorized people, and never use it for personal gain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integrity and security</strong><br />
              IT professionals should prevent unauthorized access, apply strong security controls,
              and regularly update systems to defend against new threats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Honesty and transparency</strong><br />
              Users should be informed about what data is collected, how it will be used, and what
              their rights are, so they can give informed consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accountability</strong><br />
              When a breach happens, ethical behavior includes reporting it quickly, cooperating
              with investigations, and fixing the weaknesses that caused it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>One sentence answer</strong><br />
              “Data privacy is a key ethical issue in IT, and the IT Code of Ethics addresses it by
              requiring confidentiality, strong security, transparency, and accountability from
              professionals.”
