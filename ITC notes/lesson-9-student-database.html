          </header>

          <p>
            Schools handle large amounts of information about students. Names, contact details, grades,
            attendance, and payments all need to be stored and updated. A <strong>student information
            database</strong> is a structured system that stores this data in an organized and consistent
            way so that staff can find the right information quickly and safely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of scattered paper forms or separate spreadsheets, a central database allows different
            offices such as the registrar, finance, and department chairs to access shared data without
            retyping the same information many times.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Tables, records, and fields</h3>
          <p>
            A database is usually divided into <strong>tables</strong>. Each table focuses on one type of
            entity, such as students, classes, or payments. In a <strong>student</strong> table, each row
            is a <strong>record</strong> for one student, and each column is a <strong>field</strong> that
            stores a specific piece of data.
          </p>

          <p>Common fields in a student table include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Student ID</strong> - a unique identifier for each student</li>
            <li><strong>Full name</strong> - first name, middle name, and last name</li>
            <li><strong>Birthdate and age</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Program and year level</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Section</strong> or block</li>
            <li><strong>Contact number</strong> and <strong>email address</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Guardian name</strong> and <strong>guardian contact</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Additional tables can store grades, subjects, and payments, which are linked back to the
            student through the Student ID.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Primary keys and relationships</h3>
          <p>
            A <strong>primary key</strong> is a field that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
            For student data, the Student ID is usually used as the primary key. No two students should
            share the same ID, which prevents confusion and duplication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other tables such as a <strong>grades</strong> table can include the Student ID as a
            <strong>foreign key</strong>, creating a relationship between the tables. This allows the
            system to list all grades for a specific student or show all students enrolled in a subject.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Benefits of a well designed student database</h3>
          <p>
            When fields and relationships are designed properly, a student information database offers
            several advantages:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - fewer repeated entries and lower risk of inconsistent data</li>
            <li><strong>Speed</strong> - faster searching, sorting, and reporting</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong> - access can be restricted to authorized staff only</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - easy generation of class lists, grade summaries, and statistics</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These benefits help the school make better decisions and provide more organized services to
            students and parents.
          </p>

          <div class="notes-summary-block">
            <h3 class="notes-subheading">Key idea</h3>
            <p>
              A student information database is built from tables, records, and fields that are linked by
              keys. Good design makes data easier to store, protect, and use.
            </p>

              <strong>Tables, records, and fields</strong><br />
              Tables group related data, each record represents one student, and fields store specific

            <li>
              <strong>Common fields</strong><br />
              Student ID, full name, birthdate, program, year level, section, contact details, and

              Other tables such as grades or payments include the Student ID as a foreign key so the

              <strong>One sentence answer</strong><br />
              “A student information database uses tables, keys, and well defined fields to store and
              organize school records so data is accurate, secure, and easy to use.”
