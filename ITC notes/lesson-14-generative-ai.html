              What is generative AI
            </h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            <strong>Generative AI</strong> refers to systems that can create new content based on patterns
            learned from data. This content can be text, images, audio, code, or video. Examples include
            chatbots that can write essays, tools that generate artwork from text prompts, and models that
            can produce computer code from descriptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            These systems do not think like humans, but they are very good at predicting what comes next in
            a sequence, such as the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in an image. This makes them
            powerful tools in many industries, especially where there is a lot of digital information.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Impact of generative AI in healthcare</h3>
          <p>
            In healthcare, generative AI can help summarize long medical records, draft reports, or suggest
            possible diagnoses based on symptoms and clinical notes. It can assist doctors by turning raw
            data into clearer explanations, or by generating patient education materials in simple language.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generative models can also support research. They can help generate synthetic medical data for
            training and testing algorithms when real patient data is limited. This can speed up innovation
            while reducing direct exposure of real patient records.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, if the model is trained on biased or low quality data, it may produce incorrect or
            unfair suggestions. Healthcare decisions are high stakes, so AI outputs must always be checked
            by qualified professionals.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Impact of generative AI in education</h3>
          <p>
            In education, generative AI can act as a study assistant. It can explain difficult topics,
            generate practice questions, summarize lessons, or adapt explanations to the student level. It
            can also help teachers by generating sample quizzes, rubrics, or lesson outlines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generative tools can support personalized learning. A student who struggles with a topic can ask
            for alternative explanations or additional examples. This can make learning more flexible and
            accessible, especially for students who do not always feel comfortable asking questions in class.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, students might depend on AI to write essays or solve assignments for them.
            This raises questions about academic honesty, real understanding, and how to fairly assess what
            students actually know.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Ethical concerns and risks</h3>
          <p>
            One major concern is <strong>misinformation</strong>. Generative AI can produce text that sounds
            confident even when it is wrong. If users copy outputs without checking, false information can
            spread quickly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another concern is <strong>data privacy</strong>. Training generative models often requires large
            datasets, which may include sensitive information. In healthcare, this can involve medical
            histories and test results. In education, it can include student work and personal details.
            Organizations must follow privacy laws and protect data from leaks.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are also issues related to <strong>bias</strong> and <strong>fairness</strong>. If the
            training data contains stereotypes or unequal representation, the AI may repeat or even amplify
            those patterns. This can affect how people are described or treated in AI generated outputs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, generative AI raises questions about <strong>responsibility</strong>. When an AI system
            is used in healthcare or education, who is accountable if something goes wrong: the developer,
            the organization, or the person who used the tool? Ethical use requires clear guidelines, human
            oversight, and transparency about what the system can and cannot do.
          </p>

          <div class="notes-summary-block">
            <h3 class="notes-subheading">Key idea</h3>
            <p>
              Generative AI can support healthcare and education by creating summaries, explanations, and
              practice materials, but it also introduces risks such as misinformation, privacy issues,
              bias, and overdependence.

              <strong>Generative AI</strong><br />
              AI systems that can create new content such as text, images, code, or audio by learning
              patterns from large datasets.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Healthcare impact</strong><br />
              Can summarize records, draft reports, support diagnosis, and generate synthetic data, but
              must be checked by professionals to avoid unsafe mistakes.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Education impact</strong><br />
              Can explain topics, generate practice questions, and personalize learning, but may encourage
              cheating or overdependence if used without guidance.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Misinformation risk</strong><br />
              Outputs can sound confident even when wrong, so users must verify important information and
              not copy everything blindly.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Privacy and bias</strong><br />
              Training often needs large datasets that may contain sensitive or biased data, so developers
              must protect privacy and work to reduce unfair patterns.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>One sentence answer</strong><br />
              “Generative AI has strong potential in healthcare and education, but it also raises ethical
              concerns about misinformation, privacy, bias, and responsible use.”
