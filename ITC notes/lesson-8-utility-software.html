          </header>

          <p>
            <strong>Utility software</strong> is a type of system software designed to help monitor,
            maintain, and protect a computer. While the operating system manages the basic functions of
            the device, utility programs focus on specific tasks such as protecting against viruses,
            cleaning up files, backing up data, or checking disk errors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Utility software often works quietly in the background, but it plays an important role in
            keeping the system <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>secure</strong>, and
            <strong>reliable</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Antivirus and security utilities</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most common types of utility software is the <strong>antivirus program</strong>.
            Antivirus utilities scan files and programs for malicious software such as viruses, worms,
            trojans, and spyware. They can block suspicious activity, quarantine infected files, and warn
            the user about dangerous downloads or websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other security utilities include <strong>firewalls</strong>, which control incoming and
            outgoing network traffic, and <strong>anti-spyware tools</strong>, which protect privacy by
            detecting unwanted tracking software.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">File management and disk utilities</h3>
          <p>
            Utility software also helps manage files and storage devices. Examples include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>File management tools</strong> that allow users to copy, move, rename, and delete files.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disk cleanup utilities</strong> that remove temporary files and free up space.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disk check tools</strong> that scan for errors on storage devices and try to repair them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>File compression programs</strong> that reduce file size for easier storage or sharing.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These utilities help keep the storage organized and reduce wasted space, which can improve
            overall system performance.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Backup and recovery utilities</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Backup utilities</strong> create copies of important files or entire drives so that
            data can be restored after a system failure, hardware damage, or accidental deletion. Some
            backup tools save data to an external drive, while others use cloud storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Recovery utilities</strong> help restore data from backups or attempt to recover files
            that were deleted or lost due to errors. Using backup and recovery tools regularly reduces the
            risk of data loss.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">System optimization and monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            Some utility programs focus on monitoring and improving system performance. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Task managers that show which programs are using CPU, memory, or network resources.</li>
            <li>System information tools that display details about hardware and software.</li>
            <li>Tuning or optimization utilities that help adjust startup programs and settings.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These tools give users and technicians a clearer picture of how the system is running and
            where problems might be coming from.
          </p>

          <div class="notes-summary-block">
            <h3 class="notes-subheading">Why utility software matters</h3>
            <p>
              Utility programs support the operating system by protecting data, cleaning storage, and
              monitoring performance.
