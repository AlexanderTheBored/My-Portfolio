          </header>

          <p>
            Modern healthcare relies heavily on computer systems. Hospitals, clinics, and laboratories use
            computers to handle patient information, support diagnosis, monitor vital signs, and provide
            services at a distance. Without these systems, medical work would be slower, more error prone,
            and harder to organize.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Electronic Health Records (EHRs)</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most important uses of computers in healthcare is handling
            <strong>Electronic Health Records</strong> or EHRs. Instead of storing information in paper
            folders, patient data is saved in a digital record. Doctors and nurses can quickly see a
            patient history, allergies, medications, lab results, and previous treatments.
          </p>
          <p>
            This improves safety and coordination. Different departments can view the same up to date
            information, which reduces mistakes and duplicated tests. It also makes it easier to update
            records after every visit or procedure.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Medical imaging and diagnosis</h3>
          <p>
            Computer systems also power <strong>medical imaging</strong> technologies such as X ray, CT,
            MRI, and ultrasound. These machines capture detailed images of the inside of the body, then use
            advanced processing to enhance and display the results clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many hospitals, software can assist doctors by highlighting suspicious areas in images,
            such as possible tumors, fractures, or blockages. This does not replace doctors, but it gives
            them another tool to support faster and more accurate diagnosis.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Patient monitoring and alerts</h3>
          <p>
            Another major role of computer systems is <strong>patient monitoring</strong>. Devices like heart
            rate monitors, oxygen sensors, and blood pressure machines are connected to central computers
            that continuously record data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthcare staff can watch multiple patients at once through a monitoring system. If a vital
            sign goes out of the safe range, the system can trigger an alarm or notification. This helps
            staff respond quickly in emergencies.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Telemedicine and health apps</h3>
          <p>
            Computer systems and networks also make <strong>telemedicine</strong> possible. Patients can
            consult with doctors through video calls, receive digital prescriptions, and get follow up
            advice without traveling to the hospital, which is especially helpful for people in remote
            areas or during a pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile health apps and wearable devices can track steps, sleep, heart rate, or blood sugar.
            These tools give patients more control over their own health and can send data to doctors for
            additional analysis and advice.
          </p>

          <div class="notes-summary-block">
            <h3 class="notes-subheading">Why computer systems matter in healthcare</h3>
            <p>
              Computer systems help healthcare become <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>safer</strong>,
              and <strong>more organized</strong>.
