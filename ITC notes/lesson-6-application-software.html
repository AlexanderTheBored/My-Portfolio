              What is application software
            </h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            <strong>Application software</strong> refers to programs that help users perform specific
            tasks. Instead of managing the computer itself, these applications focus on work that
            people want to do: writing documents, analyzing numbers, editing photos, or communicating
            with others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding the different types of application software helps explain why we use certain
            programs every day and how organizations choose tools for school, business, or government.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">General-purpose application software</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>General-purpose applications</strong> are flexible tools that can be used in many
            different situations and subjects. They are not limited to one specific industry.
          </p>

          <p>Common examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Word processors</strong> for writing essays, reports, letters, and simple layouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spreadsheets</strong> for organizing data, performing calculations, and creating charts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Presentation software</strong> for slideshows used in classes, meetings, or seminars.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Email and messaging clients</strong> for communication and collaboration.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Because these tools are so flexible, the same application can be used by students, teachers,
            office workers, and managers for different purposes.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Specialized or domain-specific software</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Specialized applications</strong> are created for a more specific task or industry.
            They are designed to match the workflow of a certain profession or organization.
          </p>

          <p>Examples of specialized software include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Accounting systems</strong> that handle invoices, payroll, and financial reports.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hospital Information Systems (HIS)</strong> used to manage patients, beds, billing,
              and medical records.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</strong> software for engineers and architects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning Management Systems (LMS)</strong> used by schools to deliver online classes
              and quizzes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These applications are often customized for each organization and may require training before
            staff can use them effectively.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Installed apps vs web and mobile apps</h3>
          <p>
            Application software can also be categorized based on how it is delivered:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Desktop applications</strong> installed directly on a computer (for example,
              a word processor installed in Windows).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web applications</strong> accessed through a browser, such as webmail or online
              document editors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile apps</strong> running on phones and tablets, often with touch-friendly
              interfaces and offline features.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Many modern tools combine these approaches, offering both desktop and web versions so users
            can access their work from different devices.
          </p>

          <div class="notes-summary-block">
            <h3 class="notes-subheading">Why application software matters</h3>
            <p>
              Application software turns a computer into a useful tool for writing, calculating, designing,
              learning, and managing information.
            </p>
