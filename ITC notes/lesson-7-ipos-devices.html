          </header>

          <p>
            Computer systems follow a basic cycle known as <strong>IPOS</strong>, which stands for
            <strong>Input</strong>, <strong>Process</strong>, <strong>Output</strong>, and
            <strong>Storage</strong>. Every task a computer performs passes through these stages. At each
            stage, different hardware components work together to receive data, transform it, present
            results, and keep information for future use.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Input devices</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Input devices</strong> allow users to send data or commands into the computer. Examples
            include the keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, microphone, and camera. These devices convert
            physical actions such as typing, clicking, touching, or speaking into digital signals that the
            computer can understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without input devices, the computer would not know what the user wants it to do. In practical
            terms, every activity starts with some kind of input, such as entering a password, clicking a
            button, or scanning a barcode at a store.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Processing components</h3>
          <p>
            After the data is collected, the system moves to the <strong>processing</strong> stage. This is
            handled mainly by the <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong>, often called the brain of
            the computer. The CPU performs calculations, follows instructions, and coordinates how data
            moves around the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other important parts support the CPU. The <strong>motherboard</strong> connects all the
            components. The <strong>system bus</strong> and <strong>chipset</strong> help data travel
            quickly between the CPU, memory, and other devices. <strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong>
            holds active data and programs while they are being used, which makes processing much faster
            than reading from long term storage.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Output devices</h3>
          <p>
            Once processing is done, the computer needs a way to show the result. This is the role of
            <strong>output devices</strong>. Common examples are monitors, speakers, printers, and
            projectors. A monitor displays text, images, and video. Speakers output sound for music,
            notifications, or voice calls. Printers create physical copies of documents and images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Output devices allow the computer to communicate its work back to the user. Without them, the
            processing would happen silently with no visible result.
          </p>

          <h3 class="notes-subheading">Storage devices</h3>
          <p>
            The final stage in the IPOS cycle is <strong>storage</strong>. Storage devices keep data so that
            it can be used again later. Examples include hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD),
            USB flash drives, memory cards, and external hard drives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storage can be <strong>permanent</strong> or <strong>temporary</strong>. Permanent storage keeps
            files even when the computer is turned off, which is why your documents and applications are
            still there when you restart your device. Temporary storage such as RAM is cleared when the
            computer shuts down. Both types are important for a smooth user experience.
          </p>

          <div class="notes-summary-block">
            <h3 class="notes-subheading">Putting it all together</h3>
            <p>
              The IPOS model shows that a computer is not just a single box. It is a system of
              <strong>input devices</strong>, <strong>processing components</strong>,
              <strong>output devices</strong>, and <strong>storage solutions</strong> that work together.
